The façade of everyday is painfully clear
Minutes turn to hours, hours disappear
Everyone is hiding, everyone’s numb
The pain of emptiness is where we’re from

From the spring of life flows eternal youth
But nothingness is louder than the truth
We chase the moment, just to feel alive
Then wonder why the hollow still survives

We trade the light for something fast
Turn our backs on what won’t last
Just one hit, just one release
Brutal recompense, temporary peace

And it pulls me under, drags me down
A beautiful lie in a burning crown
I feel it hit, then slip away
A dark downtempo heart on replay

I reach for meaning, it fades from sight
Led away from love, away from light
I want the truth, but I still pretend
I fall again, again, again

To ensnare emotion, to free us all
Captivate the mind before the ravenous fall
The pain of destitution never subsides
It synthesizes deep inside

A burden humming under skin
A signal breaking where we’ve been
Like darkness masquerading as glow
A ray that blinds, but doesn’t show

We call it freedom, call it choice
But drown conviction in the noise
Just one taste, just one escape
Glass in the soul, a perfect break

And it pulls me under, drags me down
A beautiful lie in a burning crown
I feel it hit, then slip away
A dark downtempo heart on replay

I reach for meaning, it fades from sight
Led away from love, away from light
I want the truth, but I still pretend
I fall again, again, again

Words can’t describe, yet words still bleed
An inner fortitude I need
It speaks forever, but never stays
A flash of fire, a dying phase

Like shattered glass inside the fray
It cuts the deepest when I stay

Pull me under
Drag me down
Beautiful lie
Burning crown

Pull me under
Hear the sound
Dark desire
Lost, not found

And it pulls me under, drags me down
A beautiful lie in a burning crown
I feel it hit, then slip away
A dark downtempo heart on replay

I reach for meaning, it fades from sight
Led away from love, away from light
I want the truth, I feel the call
But still… I fall

Forever it speaks, but only stays
For just a moment
Then fades
