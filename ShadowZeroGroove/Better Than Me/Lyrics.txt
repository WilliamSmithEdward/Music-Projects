I watch you move through the room
Like you don’t know what you do
Every light seems to follow
Every shadow leaves too

I try to stand where you are
But I’m always a step behind
You say my name like it’s safe
I don’t hear it that way in my mind

You deserve something better than me
Something lighter, something free
I love you more than I can say
That’s why I keep myself away

I hold my breath when you smile
Like I might break something true
You look at me like I’m steady
I don’t see what you see when you do

I’d give you all that I am
If I thought it would be enough
But I don’t trust these hands
I don’t trust this love

You deserve something better than me
Something lighter, something free
I love you more than I can say
That’s why I keep myself away

You deserve more than I can be
Something whole, something clean
I love you in the quiet way
That doesn’t ask you to stay

I’m not asking you to leave
I’m just scared you’ll believe
That I’m all you need

You deserve something better than me
Something lighter, something free
I love you more than I can say
That’s why I keep myself away

You deserve more than I can be
Something whole, something clean
I love you in the quiet way
And let you go the same
