Slow downtempo track at 65–80 BPM with a calm, weightless feel. Style is rooted in Zero 7’s melodic restraint and rich harmony, with a strong piano-led emotional core. Piano melody is foregrounded, expressive but unhurried, using jazzy extensions, suspended chords, and gentle harmonic turns that feel curious rather than dramatic. Groove is soft and supportive: brushed or minimal electronic drums, deep smooth bass that glides without pushing. Pads and textures are warm, wide, and subtle, creating space rather than filling it. Influence the atmosphere of Jupiter Light: airy, luminous, and serene. The track should evoke floating through space, slowly orbiting or observing something vast and beautiful, like Venus glowing against darkness. No drops, no tension spikes. Emotional tone is wonder, peace, and quiet awe. Let harmony and melody carry the interest, not rhythm or density.
