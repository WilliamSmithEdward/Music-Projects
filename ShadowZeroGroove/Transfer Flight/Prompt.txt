Moderately downtempo track at 70–85 BPM. Blends the warm, introspective melodic restraint of Zero 7 with the global, dub-leaning, psychedelic soul. Groove is steady and hypnotic: soft breakbeats, dub-influenced bass, subtle hand percussion, and organic rhythmic textures drawn from rainforest ritual. Harmony is rich but understated, with repeating chord cycles that feel ancient and familiar, like something remembered rather than written. Melodies should feel eerily recognizable, as if overheard in a dream or another life. Use ambient field textures, distant chants or wordless vocal tones, gentle delays, and spatial effects to suggest a spiritual encounter that was profound but incomplete. The emotional arc is awe, warmth, and déjà vu, followed by quiet forgetting. Not enlightenment, but the memory of almost having it. The track should feel like a soul journey through the Amazon, a fleeting encounter with God, and the strange peace of losing it on the way home.
