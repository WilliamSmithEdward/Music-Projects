Downtempo electronic track at 65–80 BPM. Warm, restrained, and quietly emotional. Grounded in the melodic softness and human warmth of Zero 7, but filtered through a retro-commercial, late-20th-century atmosphere. The music should feel like melancholy drifting through a public space, familiar and oddly comforting, as if playing overhead in a softly lit department store decades ago. Harmony is nostalgic and slightly wistful, using simple but emotionally loaded chord progressions, gentle key shifts, and unresolved moments that suggest sadness without despair. Melody is understated, memorable, and looping, almost anonymous, like something you recognize without knowing why. Sound design blends warm synth pads, muted electric piano, soft electronic pulses, and subtle tape-like texture. The track should feel emotionally sincere but packaged in an unassuming, everyday context: sadness softened by routine, memory hidden inside normalcy. Overall tone is calm, reflective, and strangely soothing,
