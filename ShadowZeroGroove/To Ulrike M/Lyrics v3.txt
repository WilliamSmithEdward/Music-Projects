I need room to breathe,
to breathe.
Street lamps, wet pavement,
wet pavement.
Side streets, slow wheels,
so slow.
Warnings in the glass,
in the glass.

A loop in the speakers,
in the speakers.
Soft kick, soft snare,
soft kick, soft snare.
A pulse I can trust,
I can trust.
Keep it low, keep it warm,
keep it warm.

Your fingers in mine,
in mine.
Not heroic,
just here.
One small shelter,
then another.
Borrowed quiet,
borrowed quiet.

Doors with codes,
codes.
Stairs, detergent,
old smoke.
Locks sound loud,
too loud.
Names get traded,
get traded.

The story changed hands,
changed hands.
Clean distance,
clean distance.
Being right,
being right.
Thirty pieces,
in a pocket.
A smile for your good,
for your good.

These days,
these days,
these days.

Blue flashes on the ceiling,
on the ceiling.
That loop returns,
returns.
You shook,
you shook.
Not from cold,
not from cold.
A kiss becomes a verdict,
a verdict.
Truth gets used,
gets used.

These days,
these days.
