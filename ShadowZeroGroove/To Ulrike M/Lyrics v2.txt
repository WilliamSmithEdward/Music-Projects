I needed room to breathe,
to breathe.
Under amber street lamps,
and wet pavement.

We took the side streets slow,
so slow.
While the city threw warnings,
at the windows.

A thin loop in the speakers,
in the speakers.
Soft kick, soft snare,
soft kick, soft snare.
Like a pulse you can trust,
you can trust.

Something feral in the dark,
beyond the fences.
Making the heart lean forward,
lean forward.

I kept your fingers in mine,
in mine.
Not heroic,
just honest.

We learned the codes,
to чуж doors.
Stairwells smelled like detergent,
and old smoke.

Borrowed couches,
borrowed quiet.
Every lock sounded louder,
than it should.

Then the story changed hands,
changed hands.
Passed around like a receipt,
like a receipt.

Someone wanted clean distance,
clean distance.
Someone wanted to be right,
be right.

Thirty pieces in a pocket,
in a pocket.
And a smile that said,
it was for your good.

These days,
these days,
these days.

I still hear that loop,
at odd hours.
When blue flashes paint the ceiling,
paint the ceiling.

And I remember how you shook,
how you shook.
Not from cold,
not from cold.

From knowing people can kiss you,
kiss you.
Then call it truth,
call it truth.

These days,
these days.
