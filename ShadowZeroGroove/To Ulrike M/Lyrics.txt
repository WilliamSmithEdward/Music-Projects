I needed room to breathe,
under amber street lamps, and wet pavement.
We took the side streets slow,
while the city threw its warnings at the windows.
A thin loop in the speakers,
soft kick, soft snare, like a pulse you can trust,
and something feral in the dark beyond the fences,
making the heart lean forward.

I kept your fingers in mine,
not heroic, just honest.
We learned the codes to чуж doors,
stairwells that smelled like detergent, and old smoke.
Borrowed couches, borrowed quiet,
every lock sounded louder than it should.

Then the story changed hands,
passed around like a receipt.
Someone wanted clean distance,
someone wanted to be right.
Thirty pieces in a pocket,
and a smile that said it was for your good.

These days,
these days,
these days.

I still hear that loop at odd hours,
when blue flashes paint the ceiling,
and I remember the way you shook,
not from cold,
from knowing people can kiss you, then call it truth.

These days,
these days.
