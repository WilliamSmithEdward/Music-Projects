Late-night downtempo electronic. 80-95 BPM, duple meter, restrained dynamics, steady understated groove, low rhythmic density. Mood: intimate, reflective, calm melancholy, accepting. Motion without arrival. Harmony: minor/modal center with ambiguity; color over function. Use m7, m9, maj7, add9, sus2/4. Slow harmonic rhythm. Smooth voice-leading, common tones. Avoid V–I, avoid strong cadences. Melody: clear lyrical memorable theme; stepwise with moderate leaps; strong contour. Motif repetition with micro-variation. Phrase ends avoid tonic closure. Solo: expressive electronic lead; modal improv; scalar runs + sustains; gradual density rise; no climax/virtuoso peak; feels like a reply. Texture: transparent layers; pads as bed; gentle comping; sparse counter-lines; no dominance. Bass warm legato, root-centered + passing tones. Timbre warm, filtered highs, long envelopes, reverb+delay for depth. Form: theme→develop→solo→return; “answer” to a prior piece.
