Slow downtempo track at 70–80 BPM. Warm, organic, spacious, and deeply immersive. The emotional center is calm and introspective, like Zero 7 at their most restrained, with gentle melancholy and human warmth. Groove is unhurried and grounded, never driving. Drums feel brushed, hand-played, or softly electronic, with tribal undertones rather than club energy. Bass is smooth, rounded, and breathing, more felt than heard. Harmonic elements include Rhodes or electric piano chords, soft guitar fragments, and lush analog pads that bloom and fade slowly. Add subtle rainforest ambience: distant insects, soft percussive textures, reverberant space, and a sense of humid air and depth. Introduce light Goa-inspired psychedelic elements as texture only: slow-moving arpeggios, sine-like motifs, gentle phase movement, and hypnotic repetition, never bright or aggressive. No drops, no buildups, no sharp transients. Wide soundstage, soft highs, deep mids. The track should feel like a tribal hallucinogen
