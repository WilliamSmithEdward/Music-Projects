Modern pop-metal/power-metal with serious weight but high drive. 4/4 at 145–160 BPM. Bar 1 hits with kick, drop C/B chugs, and a synth lead stating the main hook. Vibe: night desert drive under a sea of stars, endless horizon, then a giant shooting star streak. Harmony: minor key with luminous lift; chorus loop i–VI–III–VII, pre-chorus climbs and widens. Hook is the star: 4-bar earworm melody, mostly stepwise, instantly singable, repeated early and often, with a 1–2 bar answer tag. Verses: tight rhythmic phrasing, steady forward motion, subtle space/echo. Pre-chorus: add layers, rising line, building tension. Chorus: massive stacked vocals, wide pads, and a soaring lead to paint the meteor streak. Bridge: short breakdown (kick+bass+drone) then melodic lead foreshadows hook, 1-beat near-silence before final chorus. Final chorus bigger with counter-melody and whole-step modulation. Synths thick: double lead/pulse with quieter octave-down layer and second patch. Mix glossy, punchy, wide.
