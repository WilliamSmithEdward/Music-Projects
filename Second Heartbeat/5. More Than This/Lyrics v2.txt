I can’t call this enough.
Another headline, another flame.
Same old anger in new clothes.
Same tight jaw, same bitter taste.
We learn the names of distant graves.
We scroll past someone else’s tears.
Then we look at who we love
and feel the clock inside our chest.

I watch the people in my life
laugh like it could last.
Then the thought comes like a cold wind.
What if this is not forever.
What if we blink, and we are gone.
What if goodbye is all we get.
I hold a hand and feel the pull
of something heavy under everything.

Like gravity.
Like a quiet drag.
Like the world keeps falling
back into the same dark.

There’s got to be more than this.
More than war, more than hate.
More than friends turned into threats.
More than love that ends in loss.
This can’t be all we are.
This can’t be all we get.
We were made for more than this.
There’s got to be more than this.

We fight over smaller pieces
while the larger thing slips away.
Pride becomes a daily language.
Mercy starts to sound naive.
Envy wears a normal face.
Jealousy gets called “being real.”
And death sits patient in the corner
like it’s waiting for its turn.

I try to live like it’s not true.
I try to stay busy and brave.
But grief comes back in small moments.
A quiet room. A drive at night.
A song that hits the wrong place.
A memory that won’t stay still.
And I keep seeing their faces,
and needing there to be a beyond.

Like gravity.
Like a quiet drag.
Like the world keeps falling
back into the same dark.

There’s got to be more than this.
More than war, more than hate.
More than friends turned into threats.
More than love that ends in loss.
This can’t be all we are.
This can’t be all we get.
We were made for more than this.
There’s got to be more than this.

If this is all, then nothing holds.
If this is all, then love is cruel.
But love in us keeps reaching past the edge.
Love in us keeps asking why.
So I will not make peace with poison.
I will not learn to call it home.
Even if I cannot see the answer,
I will keep looking for the door.

There’s got to be more than this.
More than war, more than hate.
More than friends turned into threats.
More than love that ends in loss.
This can’t be all we are.
This can’t be all we get.
We were made for more than this.
There’s got to be more than this.

More than this.
More than this.
