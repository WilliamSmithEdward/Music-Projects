I thought it would come with metal in the skin.
A socket, a port, a cold blue light.
Something you could point to and call it the moment.
Something obvious, something loud.
But it came the quiet way,
like weather, like habit, like drift.
It took the space where my thoughts used to echo
and filled it with a soft, shared script.

We learned to speak in signals, not sentences.
We learned to feel on a delay.
We learned to trade our names for a version that lands well,
then wonder why we feel thin.
No needle, no implant, no machine in the blood,
just a constant pull on the inner room.
A hand on the dial of the heart,
turning it down, turning it fast.

You don’t need a wire to be guided.
You don’t need a chip to be shaped.
If it can steer what you fear,
it can steer what you love.
If it can borrow your attention,
it can borrow your life.

You think it’s coming later,
like a scene you saw on a screen.
But look at the way we move through each other now.
Look at the way we leave the moment to be elsewhere.
Look at the way we outsource the soul
to whatever speaks the quickest.
Look at the way the crowd gets inside us
before we even know we agreed.

We don’t lose our minds, we lease them.
We don’t break our hearts, we hand them off.
We call it normal because it’s everywhere,
because it never sleeps.
We forget how to sit with one thought
until it becomes our own.
We forget the feel of a steady self
when no one is watching.

So wake up, not in panic,
in clarity, in clean light.
This isn’t a future story,
it’s a present pattern.
Name it, and the spell gets smaller.
See it, and it can’t pretend.
You don’t need to touch the machine
for it to touch you.

You don’t need a wire to be guided.
You don’t need a chip to be shaped.
If it can steer what you fear,
it can steer what you love.
If it can borrow your attention,
it can borrow your life.
Call it what it is, call it what it does,
call it the pressure you learned to breathe.
We’re already changed in ways we don’t feel,
the hive is in the air.

A thousand whispers, one direction.
A thousand mirrors, one face.
A thousand hands pulling at the thread
that keeps you whole.
And still there is a doorway back
to the quiet that tells the truth.
Not by fleeing the world,
by returning to your own mind.
By taking your heart off the leash.
By choosing to be present again.

You don’t need a wire to be guided.
You don’t need a chip to be shaped.
If it can steer what you fear,
it can steer what you love.
If it can borrow your attention,
it can borrow your life.
Say it out loud, let the fever break.
Say it with your eyes open.
It’s already here, it’s already close,
the hive is in the air.
