Haunting melodic pop-metal/power-metal cover vibe: a dark metal ballad that erupts into a heavier second act. 4/4, 72–84 BPM (half-time space), later switch to urgent double-time feel (same BPM or 2x feel). Intro: piano or clean guitar + wide pad + distant choir stack. Verse: intimate, restrained, minimal drums, tight phrasing. Pre-chorus: rising melody, add synth pulse + tom build, widen stereo. Chorus: EXTREMELY catchy 4-bar hook melody (stepwise, singable, repeatable), massive stacked harmonies, choir-like layers, simple minor loop (i–VI–III–VII) with occasional harmonic-minor lift. After 2nd chorus: “Part 2” heavier: drop C/B guitars, palm-muted riffs, punchy modern drums, synths still driving. Bridge: breakdown to drone + kick + bass, then melodic lead foreshadows hook. Final chorus: biggest, add counter-melody, optional whole-step modulation. Mix glossy, clean separation, heavy not harsh.
