Haunting but powerful melodic pop-metal/power-metal cover vibe: emotional minor-key song that surges into a heavier second act. 4/4, 92–102 BPM (drums often imply double-time in choruses). Intro: clean guitar or piano + warm pad, but keep forward motion with a subtle pulse. Verse: intimate yet driving (light kick/snare, muted guitars), tight phrasing. Pre-chorus: rising melody, add synth pluck/pulse + tom lift, widen stereo. Chorus: EXTREMELY catchy 4-bar hook melody (stepwise, singable, repeatable), huge stacked harmonies, choir layers as support (not dirge), simple minor loop (i–VI–III–VII) with occasional harmonic-minor lift. After 2nd chorus: “Part 2” heavier: drop C/B guitars, palm-muted riffs, punchy modern drums, synths still present and rhythmic. Bridge: breakdown to drone + kick + bass + pulse, then melodic lead foreshadows hook. Final chorus: biggest, add counter-melody, optional whole-step modulation. Mix glossy, clean separation, heavy not harsh.
