We measure our lives with borrowed weight.
We call it value. We call it proof.
We stack the days like bars of gold
to buy a name that will not last.
We trade our breath for something bright.
We trade our peace for being seen.
And we forget to ask the question
that could set us free.

Who taught us to count our souls.
Who taught us worth is something earned.
We chase meaning in heavy things,
in money, rank, and praise.
As if purpose can be purchased.
As if love can be arranged.

We bow to a ghost.
We bow to a ghost.
We bend for what we cannot hold.
We carry weight that is not real.
We bow to a ghost.

We live inside a moving scale.
Always up. Always down.
Always more before we rest.
Always less before we breathe.
We call the tired ones lazy.
We call the slow ones weak.
We call the poor ones careless,
then act like we are clean.

It turns the soul into a product.
It turns the neighbor into noise.
It turns the world into a race
where no one really wins.
We say the clock is real because it rules.
We say the grind is real because it pays.
But the only thing that’s real is this,
the harm we do each day.

We bow to a ghost.
We bow to a ghost.
We bend for what we cannot hold.
We carry weight that is not real.
We bow to a ghost.

If the weight is not real,
why do we bleed for it.
If the weight is not real,
why do we bow.
We built a god from empty measures.
We built a throne from fear.
We built a life on numbers
and called it meaning.

We bow to a ghost.
We bow to a ghost.
We bend for what we cannot hold.
We carry weight that is not real.
We bow to a ghost.

Wake up. The weight is not real.
