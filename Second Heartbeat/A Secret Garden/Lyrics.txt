We lined up the keys like judges.
Black and white, clean and hard.
We told ourselves the world could fit
inside a right hand and a wrong.
We made a law out of the sound.
We made a verdict out of chords.
We forgot the breath between the notes.
We forgot what music is for.

We learned to play with clenched teeth.
We learned to play to win.
We called it wisdom when it hardened us.
We called it truth when it cut.
We counted every wrong step twice.
We kept the score in our own heads.
And the more we chased the perfect key,
the less we heard the song.

We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
If you listen, it’s still there.
We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
And it is calling us back.

We stood where the green was growing.
We reached for what looked like sight.
We took the branch and named the world.
We took the taste and called it life.
But the room went cold and quiet.
The air felt sharp and thin.
We gained the weight of knowing labels
and lost the will to sing.

We turned the garden into court.
We turned the table into test.
We turned the living into lessons
and could not find our rest.
We had the keys, we had the rules,
we had the right notes in a row.
But the song never got played,
and the melody never got heard.

We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
If you listen, it’s still there.
We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
And it is calling us back.

So wake up from the counting.
Wake up from the scale.
Stop living like the whole world ends
if we might fail.
We were not made to live as judges.
We were not made to live as stone.
We were made to love the music,
and finally come back home.

We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
If you listen, it’s still there.
We forgot the song.
We forgot the song.
But if you listen, there’s a melody.
And it is calling us back.
