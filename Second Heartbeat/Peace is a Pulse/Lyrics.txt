We drive through the desert at night.
A sea of stars, no city glow.
The road is black and endless.
The engine hum is low.

We thought we could outrun the feeling.
We thought a new place would change our skin.
We thought peace was out there somewhere,
waiting for us to arrive.

But panic travels with us.
Stress rides in the passenger seat.
Anxiety speaks in our own voice.
Fear keeps time with every mile.

We looked for peace in faces.
We looked for peace in hands.
We asked our loved ones to fill the space
we would not face alone.
And when that peace is missing,
even love feels sharp and thin.
Even the closest people
start to feel far away.

Peace is a pulse.
A steady heartbeat in the dark.
Peace is a pulse.
Not built from what surrounds us.
Peace is a pulse.
If it breaks, we break with it.
Peace is a pulse.
And we don’t know what it was
until it’s gone.

We keep reaching for more noise.
More plans. More proof. More speed.
We keep chasing the next comfort
like it will cure the ache.
But every new thing fades.
Every new voice falls quiet.
And we are left with the same question
in the same empty place.

Then a shooting star cuts the whole sky.
A long bright line from edge to edge.
And we make a wish without speaking,
because the wish is older than words.
And deep in our soul we know it,
not as a guess, not as a hope,
but as a quiet certainty,
like something inside us just unlocked.

Peace is a pulse.
A steady heartbeat in the dark.
Peace is a pulse.
Not built from what surrounds us.
Peace is a pulse.
If it breaks, we break with it.
Peace is a pulse.
And we don’t know what it was
until it’s gone.

So we stop asking the world to hold us.
We stop begging the road for a sign.
We stop putting our weight on people
like they were meant to be our ground.
We let the desert be silent.
We let the stars stay bright.
And we listen for the one sure thing
that does not change with the night.

Peace is a pulse.
A steady heartbeat in the dark.
Peace is a pulse.
Not built from what surrounds us.
Peace is a pulse.
If it breaks, we break with it.
Peace is a pulse.
So let it come back to us,
like light through closed eyes.
