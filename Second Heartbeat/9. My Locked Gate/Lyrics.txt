I ran my hands on a locked gate
like iron could explain my heart
I counted every step I took
and still felt miles apart
I kept my eyes on what I lacked
I kept my breath on what I owed
I thought love was a debt to pay
so I stayed out in the cold

I wore my “maybe” like a bruise
I learned to smile through the strain
I tried to be enough for it
I tried to earn a name
I pushed and prayed and promised more
like more could make me whole
I thought the gift would come with terms
so I swallowed all the “no”

The gate was never locked
the gate was never locked at all
I was shaking bars in the dark
while it was open the whole time
The gate was never locked
no chain, no key, no hidden cost
I was ready to pay with my life
and it was mine before I tried

I lived like love was far away
like I had to prove I could stay
I held my breath to hold it close
and watched it slip each day
I waited for the final test
for the moment I’d be caught
but the gift just kept on coming
like it didn’t need my thoughts

Then I saw it, clear and sudden
not a trick, not a delay
not a prize behind a warning sign
not a wage I had to make
Just beauty, just mercy, just light
in a place I couldn’t hide
And I felt my fists unclench
like my whole life changed its mind

The gate was never locked
the gate was never locked at all
I was shaking bars in the dark
while it was open the whole time
The gate was never locked
no chain, no key, no hidden cost
I was ready to pay with my life
and it was mine before I tried

I don’t have to bargain
I don’t have to beg
I don’t have to bleed for it
to let it hold my neck
I don’t have to buy it
I don’t have to fight
I just have to stop pretending
I can earn this kind of bright

The gate was never locked
the gate was never locked at all
I was shaking bars in the dark
while it was open the whole time
The gate was never locked
no chain, no key, no hidden cost
I was ready to pay with my life
and it was mine before I tried
