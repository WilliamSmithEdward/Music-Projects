Hard, fast modern pop-metal/power-metal love song with ironic contrast: aggressive frame, sweet heart. 4/4 at 175–195 BPM. Bar 1 hits with kick, drop C/B chugs, and a sweet hook melody on layered synth lead. Harmony and melodic variation are the focus: smooth voice-leading, frequent melodic answers/counters, and stacked harmonies. Chorus is huge and simple (i–VI–III–VII or I–V–vi–IV), while verses/pre-chorus add brighter lifts, passing chords, and tasteful secondary dominants for motion. Hook is the star: 4-bar earworm melody, mostly stepwise, instantly singable, repeated early and often, with a short answer tag. Verses stay rhythmic but still melodic with call-and-response lines. Pre-chorus climbs and widens with harmony stacks and octave lift. Bridge: brief half-time stomp, then a soaring lead that interlocks with the hook. Final chorus bigger with counter-melody and whole-step modulation. Synths thick: double lead/pulse with quieter octave-down layer and second patch. glossy, punchy
