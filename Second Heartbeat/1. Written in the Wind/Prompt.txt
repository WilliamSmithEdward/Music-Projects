Write a modern melodic/power metal track with pop-level hooks and electronic polish. 4/4 at 92–98 BPM, but arrange drums/guitars so it often feels double-time in choruses. Low-tuned rhythm guitars (drop C or drop B), tight palm-muted riff motifs, bright synth layers (sidechained pads + pulse/pluck), and a huge anthemic chorus. Harmony stays simple and singable: use i–VI–III–VII in a minor key for the main loop, with a pre-chorus that climbs and widens. Chorus vocals are stacked and wide; verses are tighter and more rhythmic. Add a bridge with a short breakdown, then modulate the final chorus up a whole step for lift. Mix: punchy kick, clean separation, glossy top, modern metal density without harshness.
