I chased a thousand doorways in the dark.
I learned new tongues for every kind of want.
I read the sky like ink on moving glass.
Still the ground stayed quiet under me.
A nagging doubt kept tugging at my sleeve.
Not to break me, only turn my head.
Like something close was asking to be seen.
Like something near refused to shout.

I thought the answer lived behind a test.
A higher mountain, colder lines to cross.
But every step I took to prove my worth
left me emptier than where I started.

It was written in the wind through the trees.
In the sway, in the hush, in the space between.
Not a prize I could hold in my hands,
not a throne I could earn with my teeth.
I was looking for meaning like a map,
but it found me like a hand on my shoulder.
It was written in the wind through the trees.
Hidden in plain sight, calling me closer.

Calling me closer.
Calling me closer.

I walked the ridge where the pines turn black.
Cold smoke rising from a sacred fire.
Old stories carved in stone and bone.
I tried to read them like a locked design.
But the air changed, sharp and clean.
The world leaned in, then held its breath.
The branches moved like they knew the way.
And something in me stopped running.

I kept my hope, but it wore thin.
I smiled at dawn, then feared the night.
I started to believe I would not find it,
then the silence broke without a sound.

It was written in the wind through the trees.
In the sway, in the hush, in the space between.
Not a prize I could hold in my hands,
not a throne I could earn with my teeth.
I was looking for meaning like a map,
but it found me like a hand on my shoulder.
It was written in the wind through the trees.
Hidden in plain sight, calling me closer.

I tried to make it perfect.
I tried to make it clean.
I tried to climb into the light
without admitting I was tired.
But the path was never punishment.
It was an invitation to return.
A presence in the ordinary
that waited while I searched.

So I stopped asking the world to explain me.
I stopped demanding a sign in the sky.
The sign was the breath in the branches.
The answer was always alive.

It was written in the wind through the trees.
In the sway, in the hush, in the space between.
Not a prize I could hold in my hands,
not a throne I could earn with my teeth.
I was looking for meaning like a map,
but it found me like a hand on my shoulder.
It was written in the wind through the trees.
Hidden in plain sight, calling me closer.

Not perfect, but found.
Not finished, but held.
