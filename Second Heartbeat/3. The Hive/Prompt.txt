Modern melodic/power metal with pop hooks and electronic polish. 4/4, 92–98 BPM. Verses feel tight and clipped; choruses feel double-time. Low-tuned guitars (drop C or B), palm-muted riff motifs, punchy modern drums, bright synth layers (sidechained pads + pulse/pluck) that sound like a repeating network signal. Harmony: minor key with i–VI–III–VII loop; pre-chorus climbs and widens. Lyrics/theme: hive mind connection, comfort and dread of “we,” identity dissolving, synced heartbeat, shared sight, signal latch-in, surrender vs resistance. Chorus: huge anthemic hook using WE/US language; stacked vocals like many voices in unison, short unison chant on 1–3 word phrase. Bridge: short breakdown, strip to kick+bass+cold drone, then a pulsing command ostinato; 1-beat silence before final chorus. Final chorus modulates up a whole step. Mix: clean separation, glossy top, heavy but not harsh; stereo narrows in verses, widens in choruses; subtle glitch micro-edits for data flow.
