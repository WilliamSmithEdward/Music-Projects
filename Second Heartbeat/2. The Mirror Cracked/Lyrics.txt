We built our answers out of borrowed voices.
We let the loudest hands hold what was holy.
We traded the weight of being awake
for something easy to repeat.

A thousand mirrors, polished and raised.
We stared until the glass felt like a judge.
We called it devotion when it was a habit,
called it conviction when it was a fence.

We wanted a guide that never trembled.
We wanted a sign that never asked us to change.
So we handed away the work of believing
and acted surprised when the world went numb.

The veil stayed on, because we liked it there.
The mirror kept us safe from being seen.
Then something in the story would not fit,
and the room inside us went still.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

No chant, no fight, no thunder in the streets.
Just a silence where the slogans used to live.
We saw the face we named our enemy
was our own, pulled sharp in the glass.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

We called it strength to never doubt our side.
We called it peace to keep the questions out.
We built a god from certainty and fear
and watched it ask for more.

We learned to love by sorting people first.
We learned to listen only for our lines.
Truth became a tool to win a point,
and love became a rumor.

And when the veil was stitched with our demands,
the city learned to breathe through clenched teeth.
Kindness got replaced with careful words.
Mercy got mistaken for defeat.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

No chant, no fight, no thunder in the streets.
Just a silence where the slogans used to live.
We saw the face we named our enemy
was our own, pulled sharp in the glass.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

At first it fell like grit behind the eyes,
a slow collapse of something trusted too much.
An idol turning softly into dust,
not by force, by what it was.

And everyone who anchored to its name
went down with it, hands full of nothing.
We felt the pull, the need to blame again,
then heard the deeper choice beneath it.

A crossroads, plain as breath.
Not to be punished, just to be honest.
The first true word was small and hard to say.
The first true step was letting go.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

No chant, no fight, no thunder in the streets.
Just a silence where the slogans used to live.
We saw the face we named our enemy
was our own, pulled sharp in the glass.

The mirror cracked.
The mirror cracked.

So let it show us what we made of faith.
Let it expose the trick we called relief.
If we can name the sickness for what it is,
we can finally start to heal.

Not with a newer mask.
Not with a stronger crowd.
With open eyes, and love that tells the truth,
and truth that never learns to hate.
