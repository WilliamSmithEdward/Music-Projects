Write a modern melodic metal song with pop chorus payoff. 95 BPM, 4/4. Use two clean vocal roles (one bright, one darker) plus short harsh vocal accents for emphasis (not constant). Verses: rhythmic, staccato, riff-led. Pre-chorus: widen harmony and add synth risers. Chorus: massive, clean, singalong, stacked harmonies, simple chord loop (i–VI–III–VII or I–vi–iii–ii depending on key). Keep harsh vocals out of the chorus except for a one-line punch. Add a bridge breakdown (guitars + bass + kick) then return with extra chorus harmonies and a higher octave lead. Keep it glossy and tight, not raw.
