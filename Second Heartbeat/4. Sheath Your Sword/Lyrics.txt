I see the whole world at once.
A thousand fires, one bright glow.
We sharpen our words like steel,
then call it love because it’s loud.
We keep score in every room.
We praise the one who strikes the hardest.
And a shadow learns our faces
when the crowd begins to cheer.

We say we fight for what is good.
We say we guard what is pure.
But we break the bridge to win the point,
and we end up standing alone.
We refuse the simple sentence
that could stop the harm right now.
We would rather win the fight
than stay human in the end.

Some make truth into a blade.
Some turn truth into smoke.
One side swings, the other shrugs,
and both leave damage in the road.
We call it freedom, call it strength,
call it “this is how it is.”
But the cost is always people,
and the cost is always love.

Sheath your sword.
Open your heart.
Stop mistaking heat for light.
Stop calling harm “being strong.”
There is a way to speak what’s real
without using it to rule.
There is a way to feel what’s real
without denying right and wrong.
Hold your ground without the hunger
to grind someone into the dust.
Let the shadow die in silence.
Sheath your sword.

I see the shadow growing huge,
fed by laughter, fed by praise.
It takes the shape of “I am right”
and wears it like a second face.
It feeds on enemies.
It feeds on friends.
It turns a neighbor into threat
and calls that damage “truth.”

Even monsters are loved by someone.
Even monsters have a name.
Even monsters were once a child
who wanted to feel safe.
So what are we becoming now,
when the crowd becomes our spine.
When we trade away our mercy
just to keep our side “right.”

Sheath your sword.
Open your heart.
Stop mistaking heat for light.
Stop calling harm “being strong.”
There is a way to speak what’s real
without using it to rule.
There is a way to feel what’s real
without denying right and wrong.
Hold your ground without the hunger
to grind someone into the dust.
Let the shadow die in silence.
Sheath your sword.

Put it back.
Not because truth is weak,
but because we are.
Truth stays true without our anger.
Truth stays true without our force.
Truth does not need a crowd.
Truth does not need a win.
If we cannot say, “I was wrong,”
we will keep cutting in the dark.

Sheath your sword.
Open your heart.
Stop mistaking heat for light.
Stop calling harm “being strong.”
There is a way to speak what’s real
without using it to rule.
There is a way to feel what’s real
without denying right and wrong.
Hold your ground without the hunger
to grind someone into the dust.
Let the shadow die in silence.
Sheath your sword.
