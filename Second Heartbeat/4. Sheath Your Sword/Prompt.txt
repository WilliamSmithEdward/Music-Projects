Modern melodic/power metal with pop hooks and electronic polish. 4/4, 92–98 BPM. Verses tight and clipped; choruses feel double-time. Low-tuned guitars (drop C or B), tight palm-muted riff motifs, punchy modern drums, bright synth layers (sidechained pads + pulse/pluck) that act like a repeating pulse. Harmony: minor key with i–VI–III–VII loop; pre-chorus climbs and widens (rising melody, added layers, widening stereo). Chorus: huge anthemic hook, stacked vocals wide and thick, short unison chant (1–3 words). Arrangement: narrow/drier verses, bigger/airier choruses. Bridge: short breakdown, strip to kick+bass+cold drone, then introduce a pulsing ostinato; include a 1-beat near-silence right before the final chorus. Final chorus modulates up a whole step for lift. Mix: clean separation, glossy top, modern metal density without harshness; subtle micro-edits for motion, but keep hooks front-and-center.
