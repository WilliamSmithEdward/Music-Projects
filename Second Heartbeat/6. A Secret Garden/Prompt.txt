Write an extremely catchy, bright, melodic pop-metal/power-metal track that hits hard from bar 1. 4/4 at 132–150 BPM (or 95–105 with constant double-time feel). No slow intro: start with the chorus hook riff AND hook melody immediately. Instrumentation: tight modern drums, drop C/B guitars with crisp chugs, bright synth lead doubling the hook, wide pads for lift. Harmony: major key or Lydian-leaning; use simple diatonic progressions (I–V–vi–IV and variations) with one signature twist chord for identity. Hook: 4-bar earworm melody, mostly stepwise, repeat it early and often; add a second “answer” motif in bars 3–4. Verse stays punchy and minimal, pre-chorus is a quick 4–8 bar rise, then chorus returns fast. Add a short bridge with a half-time stomp and a chant, then final chorus with added counter-melody and octave lift. Production: glossy, loud, clean separation, huge stereo width, zero muddiness; make the first bar feel like the song already started before you pressed play.

Catchy, melodic pop-metal/power-metal track that hits instantly but feels nostalgic, like finding something lost. 4/4 at 128–145 BPM (or 95–105 with double-time feel). No slow intro: open with hook riff and melody. Tone: sweet, wistful, powerful. Instruments: tight modern drums, drop C/B guitars with crisp chugs, warm synth lead doubling the hook, airy pads for lift. Harmony: major with minor tint (vi focus or I–V–vi–IV). Hook: 4-bar melody, stepwise and memorable, repeat early; short “answer” phrase on bars 3–4. Verse is lean and rhythmic; pre-chorus builds quickly; chorus returns fast. Bridge: half-time groove + chant, then final chorus with octave lift or counter-line. Production: glossy, loud, wide, warm highs, clear mids. The first bar should feel instantly familiar, like the song was waiting for you to remember it.

Modern Amaranthe/Metalite-style pop-metal: fast, hook-first, aggressive but clean. 4/4 at 160–190 BPM (or 105–120 with constant double-time). No intro: bar 1 hits with kick + tight chugs + synth lead playing the hook melody. Drop C/B guitars, palm-muted riff cells, big snare, tight modern kicks, bright-but-smooth synth layers (pulse/pluck + lead doubling). Tone: nostalgic and sweet inside a hard frame. Harmony: major with minor tint (I–V–vi–IV, vi–IV–I–V), add one signature twist chord for identity. Chorus: EXTREMELY catchy 4-bar earworm, mostly stepwise, repeat immediately; add an “answer” tag in bars 3–4; stacked vocal harmonies wide and thick. Verse: rhythmic, minimal melody, groove-forward. Pre-chorus: quick rise with added layers and octave lift. Bridge: short half-time stomp + chant, then final chorus bigger with counter-melody and optional whole-step modulation. Mix: glossy, loud, punchy, clean separation, heavy without harsh highs.
