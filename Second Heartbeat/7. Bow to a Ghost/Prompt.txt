Modern pop-metal/power-metal that is serious and heavy but high energy and driven. 4/4 at 175–190 BPM. No long intro: bar 1 hits with kick, drop C/B chugs, and the synth hook lead. Tone weighty and urgent, not harsh. Harmony: minor key; chorus loop i–VI–III–VII, pre-chorus climbs and widens. Hook is the star: a 4-bar banger melody, mostly stepwise, instantly singable, repeated early and often, with a 1–2 bar answer tag. Chorus: huge stacked vocal harmonies wide and thick. Verses: tight rhythmic phrasing, minimal melody, groove-forward. Pre-chorus: fast rise, added layers, octave lift. Bridge: short breakdown (kick+bass+drone) then melodic lead foreshadows hook, 1-beat near-silence before final chorus. Final chorus bigger with counter-melody and whole-step modulation. Synths must be thick: double the lead and pulse with a quieter octave-down layer and a second patch. Mix glossy, punchy, clean separation, heavy without harsh highs.
